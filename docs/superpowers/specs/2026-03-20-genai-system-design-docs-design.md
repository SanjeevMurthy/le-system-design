# Design Spec: Generative AI System Design Knowledge Base

**Date**: 2026-03-20
**Status**: Draft
**Scope**: Build a production-grade, research-driven GenAI system design documentation layer under `docs/genai/`

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The existing repository contains a comprehensive traditional system design knowledge base (62 topic files, 14 case studies, 153 glossary terms) but has zero coverage of Generative AI system design. The single GenAI source file (`source/GenAI/Kubernetes for Generative AI Solutions.pdf`) is insufficient. A complete GenAI knowledge base must be built primarily from deep research, covering foundations through production patterns.

## 2. Goals

- Cover the full GenAI system design lifecycle: foundations, inference, RAG, agents, evaluation, safety, production
- Include real-world examples from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, Perplexity, GitHub Copilot, LangChain/LlamaIndex ecosystems
- Maintain architect-level depth — decision-making references, not tutorials
- Follow the existing repo convention: one concept = one canonical file, no duplication
- Cross-link with existing traditional system design docs where concepts overlap

## 3. Non-Goals

- Runnable code samples or tutorials
- Covering traditional system design topics already in `docs/` (cross-link instead)
- Model training from scratch (focus is on system design, not ML research)
- Vendor-specific deployment guides

## 4. Architecture Decision: Namespace Isolation

All GenAI docs live under `docs/genai/` to cleanly separate from the existing traditional system design knowledge base. This enables:
- Independent navigation and learning paths
- Clear ownership boundaries
- No naming collisions (both KBs have "patterns", "performance", "safety" concepts)
- Cross-linking between the two KBs via relative paths

**Total: 54 canonical topic files + 1 index + 3 meta artifacts = 58 files**

## 6. Mandatory Template

Every canonical file follows this 12-section structure:

```markdown
# <Topic Name>

## 1. Overview
Brief definition, why this matters, 2-3 sentence positioning.

## 2. Where It Fits in GenAI Systems
How this topic connects to the broader pipeline. Short paragraph + positioning diagram.

## 3. Core Concepts
Technical meat — subtopics, definitions, mechanisms. Deepest section.

## 4. Architecture
MUST include at least one Mermaid diagram. System-level view of components and data flow.

## 5. Design Patterns
Named patterns with when-to-use guidance.

## 6. Implementation Approaches
Concrete approaches, tool/framework options, configuration examples (pseudocode, not runnable code).

## 7. Tradeoffs
Decision tables: Option A vs B vs C with axes like cost, latency, quality, complexity.

## 8. Failure Modes
What goes wrong and how to detect/mitigate. Production war stories where available.

## 9. Optimization Techniques
How to improve performance, reduce cost, increase quality.

## 10. Real-World Examples
MUST name companies/products. At least 3 per topic.
Format: Company — what they do — why it matters.

## 11. Related Topics
Cross-links to other GenAI files and traditional system design docs.

## 12. Source Traceability
Where the information came from (research, papers, documentation).
```

## 7. Required Architectural Diagrams

Three mandatory diagrams must appear across the knowledge base:

### RAG Pipeline (in `rag/rag-pipeline.md`)
```
User Query → Query Transform → Retriever → Reranker → Context Assembly → LLM → Response
```

### Agent Loop (in `agents/agent-architecture.md`)
```
User → Planner → Tool Selection → Tool Execution → Observation → Memory → Planner (loop)
```

### LLM Inference Pipeline (in `llm-architecture/model-serving.md`)
```
Input → Tokenizer → Prefill → KV Cache → Decode (autoregressive) → Detokenizer → Output
```

Additional Mermaid diagrams are required in every file's Section 4 (Architecture).

## 8. Content Standards

- **Depth**: Architect-level decision-making references, not tutorials or textbook explanations
- **Diagrams**: Every file must have Mermaid diagrams in sections 2 and 4
- **Real-world examples**: Every file must reference at least 3 companies/products with specifics
- **No duplication**: Each concept has exactly one canonical home; other files cross-link
- **Cross-linking**: Each file links to both GenAI siblings and traditional system design docs
- **Research-driven**: Content must go beyond the `/source` directory; incorporate industry best practices, modern architectures, and real-world implementations

## 9. Learning Path

```
Stage 1: Foundations
  transformers → llm-landscape → tokenization → embeddings → multimodal-models

Stage 2: How LLMs Run
  model-serving → gpu-compute → quantization → kv-cache → context-scaling

Stage 3: Model Customization
  model-selection → fine-tuning → distillation → training-infrastructure

Stage 4: RAG (the #1 enterprise pattern)
  rag-pipeline → document-ingestion → chunking → retrieval-reranking → graphrag → multimodal-rag

Stage 5: Vector Infrastructure
  embedding-models → vector-databases → ann-algorithms → hybrid-search

Stage 6: Prompt Engineering
  prompt-patterns → structured-output → context-management → prompt-injection

Stage 7: Agents
  agent-architecture → tool-use → memory-systems → multi-agent → code-agents

Stage 8: Orchestration
  orchestration-frameworks → prompt-chaining → build-vs-buy

Stage 9: Production Readiness
  eval-frameworks → hallucination-detection → benchmarks → llm-observability
  guardrails → pii-protection → red-teaming → ai-governance
  latency-optimization → semantic-caching → cost-optimization → model-routing

Stage 10: Case Studies & Patterns
  chatbot-architecture → copilot-architecture → enterprise-search → voice-ai
  genai-gateway → kubernetes-genai → genai-design-patterns → deployment-patterns
```

## 10. Deduplication Rules with Existing Docs

| Concept | Canonical Home (existing `docs/`) | GenAI files may... |
|---------|----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Vector search / ANN basics | `patterns/recommendation-engines.md` | Expand fully in `genai/vector-search/` (justified: GenAI needs dedicated depth) |
| Kubernetes / autoscaling | `scalability/autoscaling.md` | Cross-link; `kubernetes-genai.md` covers GPU-specific K8s only |
| Rate limiting | `resilience/rate-limiting.md` | Cross-link; `cost-optimization.md` covers LLM API quota specifics |
| Circuit breaker | `resilience/circuit-breaker.md` | Cross-link; `genai-design-patterns.md` covers LLM-specific retry/fallback |
| Caching strategies | `caching/caching.md` | Cross-link; `semantic-caching.md` covers embedding-based cache only |
| Search & indexing | `patterns/search-and-indexing.md` | Cross-link; `hybrid-search.md` covers vector+keyword fusion |
| Encryption / TLS | `security/encryption.md` | Cross-link only; GenAI safety covers AI-specific concerns |
| Monitoring / Prometheus | `observability/monitoring.md` | Cross-link; `llm-observability.md` covers LLM-specific tracing only |

## 11. Meta Artifacts

### `docs/genai/index.md`
- Learning roadmap (10 stages)
- Topic navigation table with all 54 files
- Quick reference links to glossary, concept index, cheat sheet (if created)
- Stats line (e.g., "54 canonical topic files | 6 case studies | X glossary terms")

### `docs/genai/meta/genai-concept-index.md`
- Every concept appears ONCE, mapped to its canonical file
- Content boundaries table (same format as existing `docs/meta/concept-index.md`)
- Aliases and related concepts for each entry

### `docs/genai/meta/genai-source-inventory.md`
- Catalog of all research sources used (papers, documentation, blog posts)
- Organized by domain

### `docs/genai/meta/genai-source-map.md`
- Which research sources informed each topic file
- Coverage matrix

### Glossary Expansion
- Add GenAI terms to the existing `docs/glossary.md` (do NOT create a separate glossary)
- Estimated ~100-150 new terms

### Root Index Update
- Update `docs/index.md` to add a Stage 7 or dedicated section linking to `docs/genai/index.md`

## 12. Execution Model

Follow the 8-phase approach from the prompt:

1. **Phase 1 — Source + Research Analysis**: Scan `/source/GenAI/`, perform deep research, output `genai-source-inventory.md`
2. **Phase 2 — Concept Taxonomy**: Build `genai-concept-index.md` with all concepts, aliases, definitions
3. **Phase 3 — Document Structure**: Create all directories and `doc-structure` reference
4. **Phase 4 — Knowledge Extraction**: For each concept, combine repo sources + research into `meta/concept-raw/` drafts
5. **Phase 5 — Final Documentation**: Write all 54 canonical files using the mandatory template
6. **Phase 6 — Index**: Create `docs/genai/index.md` with learning roadmap
7. **Phase 7 — Source Map**: Create `genai-source-map.md`
8. **Phase 8 — Glossary**: Expand `docs/glossary.md` with ~100-150 GenAI terms

### Parallelization Strategy
- Use up to 3 parallel agents per batch
- Group files by domain for parallel writing (e.g., all `foundations/` files in one batch)
- Each agent writes 3-5 files per invocation
- Estimated ~10-12 batches to complete all 54 files
